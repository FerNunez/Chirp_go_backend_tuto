// My notes:
- FileServer returns a handler that serves HTTP requests with the contents of the file system rooted at root.
- A fileserver is a kind of simple web server that serves static files from the host machine
- http.Dir to convert a filepath (in our case a dot: . which indicates the current directory) to a director
